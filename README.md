# Amazon-Prime-Video-Recommendation-System

## ABSTRACT
In recent years, recommendation systems have evolved as a solution to the problem of information overload by presenting users with the most appropriate products from a vast amount of data. The goal of online collaborative movie ideas for media products is to assist customers in obtaining their favorite films by pinpointing precisely identical people or films from their prior shared searches. The lack of data makes neighbor choosing more difficult with the rapid development of movies and consumers. This study demonstrates the capability of ML models to recommend the user with the top 5 recommendations when the user starts searching for a particular movie or TV-show with respective to its genre, description, cast, director, etc. In particular, four standards models, such as KNN, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Complement Naive Bayes, and Bernoulli Naive Bayes have been used in this study.

## KEYWORDS
**Datamining:** Data extraction has become incredibly difficult. Because of the large size of the data set, traditional data analysis tools and methodologies are frequently ineffective. As a result, we employ data mining technology. Data mining is the process of identifying usable information in massive data sources automatically. To improve information retrieval systems, data mining methods have been used.

**Dataset:** It is a collection of data.

**Data Preprocessing:** The goal of preprocessing is to convert raw input data into a format suited for further analysis. It entails combining data from several sources, cleaning the data to reduce noise and duplicate observations, and picking records and features.

**Machine learning:** Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that is widely described as a machine's ability to mimic intelligent human behavior.

**Recommendation System:** A recommender system, often known as a recommendation system (occasionally replaced by a synonym such as platform or engine), is a type of information filtering system that provides suggestions for items that are most relevant to a certain user.
